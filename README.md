# Leaderboard Table

This project is a simple leaderboard table built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The table allows the addition of players, recording victories, ties, defeats, and actions such as resetting points.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

### HTML (`index.html`)

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. Here are the main elements:

- An input field for the player's name.
- A button to add new players.
- A table to display the player's rankings.
- A button to reset all players' points.

### CSS (`styles.css`)

The CSS file provides visual styles for the page. Some notable points include:

- A background with wallpaper containing various drawings.
- Styling for the table, buttons, and other page elements.

### JavaScript (`index.js`)

The JavaScript file contains the application logic. Here are the main features:

- Creating players using the `createPlayer` function.
- Adding players to the `players` list.
- Dynamic table update with the `setupTable` function.
- Functions to add victories, ties, and defeats.
- Resetting all players' points with the `resetPoints` function.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the player's name in the appropriate field and click "Add Player."
3. Interact with the "Victory," "Tie," and "Defeat" buttons to record player results.
4. Use the "Reset Points" button to reset all players' points.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a compatible web browser for the best experience.
- Styles can be adjusted in the CSS file as needed.
- The table is updated automatically after each action.

Have fun exploring the leaderboard table!
